# Installation Script for Odoo Open Source

This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.

## Installing Nginx
If you set the parameter ```INSTALL_NGINX``` to ```True``` you should also configure workers. Without workers you will probably get connection loss issues. Look at [the deployment guide from Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/setup/deploy.html) on how to configure workers.

## Installation procedure

##### 1. Download the script:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrmuwanika/odoo/18.0/install_odoo_ubuntu.sh
```
##### 2. Modify the parameters as you wish.
There are a few things you can configure, this is the most used list:<br/>
```OE_USER``` will be the username for the system user.<br/>
```GENERATE_RANDOM_PASSWORD``` if this is set to ```True``` the script will generate a random password, if set to ```False```we'll set the password that is configured in ```OE_SUPERADMIN```. By default the value is ```True``` and the script will generate a random and secure password.<br/>
```OE_PORT``` is the port where Odoo should run on, for example 8069.<br/>
```OE_VERSION``` is the Odoo version to install, for example ```14.0``` for Odoo V14.<br/>
```IS_ENTERPRISE``` will install the Enterprise version on top of ```18.0``` if you set it to ```True```, set it to ```False``` if you want the community version of Odoo 16.<br/>
```OE_SUPERADMIN``` is the master password for this Odoo installation.<br/>
```INSTALL_NGINX``` is set to ```True``` by default. Set this to ```False``` if you don't want to install Nginx.<br/>
```WEBSITE_NAME``` Set the website name here for nginx configuration<br/>
```ENABLE_SSL``` Set this to ```True``` to install [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntufocal-nginx) and configure nginx with https using a free Let's Encrypted certificate<br/>
```ADMIN_EMAIL``` Email is needed to register for Let's Encrypt registration. Replace the default placeholder with an email of your organisation.<br/>
```INSTALL_NGINX``` and ```ENABLE_SSL``` must be set to ```True``` and the placeholder in ```ADMIN_EMAIL``` must be replaced with a valid email address for certbot installation<br/>
  _By enabling SSL though Let's Encrypt you agree to the following [policies](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy)_ <br/>

#### 3. Make the script executable
```
sudo chmod +x install_odoo_ubuntu.sh
```
##### 4. Execute the script:
```
sudo ./install_odoo_ubuntu.sh
```

The installation should take about 10 minutes to complete and then you will be able to access it from
anywhere in the world by entering its ipaddress.
